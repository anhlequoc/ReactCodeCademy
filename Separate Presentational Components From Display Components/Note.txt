Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern.
Here's the basic idea behind it: if a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn't also have to render HTML-like JSX.

Instead of rendering HTML-like JSX, the component should render another component. It should be that component's job to render HTML-like JSX.

Following this pattern separates your business logic from your presentational logic, which is a Good Thing.

---
- A presentational component will always get rendered by a container component.
- The container component does the work of figuring out what to display. The presentational component does the work of actually displaying it. If a component does a significant amount of work in both areas, then that's a sign that you should use this pattern!
